# Target Lists

Scripts to generate various lists of observing proposals submitted to the Chandra Space Telescope: observed, proposed, archived, theory.

First, the script queries the database for the desired category of proposals, organizes them into arrays and dictionaries based on science sub-category, then generates HTML files for displaying target lists on various pages throughout Chandra's internal and external webpages.
